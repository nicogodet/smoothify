A Python package for smoothing and refining geometries derived from raster data classifications. Smoothify transforms jagged polygons and lines resulting from raster-to-vector conversion into smooth, visually appealing features using an optimized implementation of Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm.

## Problem

Polygons and lines derived from classified raster data (e.g., ML model predictions, spectral indices, or remote sensing classifications) often have unnatural "stair-stepped" or "pixelated" edges that:

- Are visually unappealing in maps and GIS applications
- Can be difficult to work with in downstream vector processing
- Don't represent the real-world features they're meant to depict

## Solution

Smoothify applies an optimized implementation of Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm along with other geometric processing to create smooth, natural-looking features while:

- Preserving the general shape and area of polygons
- Supporting all shapley geometry types
- Handling shapes with interior holes
- Efficiently processing large datasets with multiprocessing

## Installation

```bash
uv add smoothify
```
or 
```bash
pip install smoothify
```

## Quick Start

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from smoothify import smoothify

# Load your polygonized raster data
polygon_gdf = gpd.read_file("path/to/your/polygons.gpkg")

# Apply smoothing (segment_length auto-detected from geometry)
smoothed_gdf = smoothify(
    geom=polygon_gdf,
    smooth_iterations=3,  # More iterations = smoother result
    num_cores=4  # Use parallel processing for large datasets
)

# Or specify segment_length explicitly (generally recommended)
smoothed_gdf = smoothify(
    geom=polygon_gdf,
    segment_length=10.0,  # Use the original raster resolution
    smooth_iterations=3,
    num_cores=4
)

# Save the result
smoothed_gdf.to_file("smoothed_polygons.gpkg")
```

### Controlling Smoothness with Iterations

The `smooth_iterations` parameter controls how smooth the result will be:

### Merging Adjacent Geometries

When processing multiple adjacent polygons, allowing merge_collection = True produces a combined result:

## General Usage

The `smoothify()` function accepts three types of input:

### 1. GeoDataFrame
```python
import geopandas as gpd
from smoothify import smoothify
# By default this will dissolve adjacent polygons before smoothing
gdf = gpd.read_file("polygons.gpkg")
smoothed_gdf = smoothify(
    geom=gdf,
    segment_length=10.0,
    smooth_iterations=3,
    num_cores=4
)

# Dissolve geometries by a specific field before smoothing
# Useful for merging adjacent polygons with the same classification
gdf_with_classes = gpd.read_file("classified_polygons.gpkg")
smoothed_by_class = smoothify(
    geom=gdf_with_classes,
    segment_length=10.0,
    smooth_iterations=3,
    merge_collection=True,
    merge_field="land_type",  # Merge adjacent geometries with same land_type
    num_cores=4
)
```

### 2. Single Geometry
```python
from shapely.geometry import Polygon
from smoothify import smoothify

polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10), (0, 10)])
smoothed_polygon = smoothify(
    geom=polygon,
    smooth_iterations=3
)
```

### 3. List of Geometries or GeometryCollection
```python
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, LineString
from smoothify import smoothify

geometries = [
    Polygon([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10), (0, 10)]),
    LineString([(0, 0), (5, 5), (10, 0)])
]
smoothed = smoothify(
    geom=geometries,
    segment_length=1.0,
    smooth_iterations=3
)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `geom` | GeoDataFrame, BaseGeometry, or list[BaseGeometry] | Required | The geometry/geometries to smooth |
| `segment_length` | float | None | Resolution of the original raster data in map units. If None (default), automatically detects by finding the minimum segment length (from a data sample). Recommended to specify explicitly when known |
| `smooth_iterations` | int | 3 | Number of Chaikin corner-cutting iterations (typically 3-5). Higher values = smoother output with more vertices |
| `num_cores` | int | 0 | Number of CPU cores for parallel processing (0 = all available cores, 1 = serial) |
| `merge_collection` | bool | True | Whether to merge/dissolve adjacent geometries in collections before smoothing |
| `merge_field` | str | None | **GeoDataFrame only**: Column name to use for dissolving geometries. Only valid when `merge_collection=True`. If None, dissolves all geometries together. If specified, dissolves geometries grouped by the column values |
| `merge_multipolygons` | bool | True | Whether to merge adjacent polygons within MultiPolygons before smoothing |
| `preserve_area` | bool | True | Whether to restore original area after smoothing via buffering (applies to Polygons only) |
| `area_tolerance` | float | 0.01 | Percentage of original area allowed as error (e.g., 0.01 = 0.01% error = 99.99% preservation). Only affects Polygons when preserve_area=True |
| `preserve_topology` | bool | False | **GeoDataFrame only**: Whether to preserve shared boundaries between adjacent polygons. When True, uses topology-aware smoothing to ensure no gaps or overlaps at shared boundaries |

## Topology-Aware Smoothing

When working with adjacent polygons that form a complete coverage (like land use maps, administrative boundaries, or parcel data), standard smoothing can cause:

- **Gaps** between polygons that should be adjacent
- **Overlaps** where smoothed boundaries cross over each other
- **Loss of topological integrity** in datasets where polygons should form a seamless coverage

Smoothify provides a **topology-aware smoothing** mode that preserves shared boundaries between adjacent polygons.

### Usage

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from smoothify import smoothify

# Load adjacent polygons (e.g., land parcels, administrative units)
gdf = gpd.read_file("land_use.gpkg")

# Smooth while preserving shared boundaries
smoothed_gdf = smoothify(
    gdf,
    segment_length=10.0,
    smooth_iterations=3,
    preserve_topology=True  # Enable topology-aware smoothing
)

# Result: smoothed polygons with no gaps or overlaps at boundaries
```

### How It Works

The topology-aware smoothing approach:

1. **Pre-processing**: Extracts all unique edges from the polygon collection and identifies shared boundaries
2. **Smoothing**: Applies Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm to each unique edge exactly once
3. **Reconstruction**: Rebuilds polygons from the smoothed edges, ensuring shared boundaries remain identical

### When to Use

Use `preserve_topology=True` when:

- Polygons represent adjacent areas that should share exact boundaries (land use, zoning, administrative units)
- You need to maintain topological relationships for spatial analysis
- Gaps or overlaps between smoothed polygons would be problematic

### Direct Function Access

You can also use the topology-aware smoothing function directly:

```python
from smoothify import smoothify_with_topology
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

# Two adjacent squares
poly1 = Polygon([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10), (0, 10)])
poly2 = Polygon([(10, 0), (20, 0), (20, 10), (10, 10)])

# Smooth while preserving the shared edge at x=10
smoothed = smoothify_with_topology(
    [poly1, poly2],
    segment_length=1.0,
    smooth_iterations=3
)
```

## How It Works

Smoothify uses an advanced multi-step smoothing pipeline:


1. Adds intermediate vertices along line segments (segmentize)
2. Generates multiple rotated variants (for Polygons) to avoid artifacts
3. Simplifies each variant to remove noise
4. Applies Chaikin corner cutting to smooth
5. Merges all variants via union to eliminate start-point artifacts
6. Applies final smoothing pass
7. Optionally restores original area via buffering (for Polygons)

## Performance Considerations

- **Parallel Processing**: For large GeoDataFrames or collections, use `num_cores` = 0 to enable parallel processing
- **Smoothing Iterations**: Values of 3-5 typically provide good results. Higher values create smoother output but increase processing time and vertex count
- **Memory Usage**: Scales with geometry complexity. The algorithm creates multiple variants during smoothing
- **Optimal segment_length**: Should match the original raster cell size (pixel size) or be slightly larger for best results
